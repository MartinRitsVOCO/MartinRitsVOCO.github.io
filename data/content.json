I began my journey in software development after about 10 years of experience in IT support, including acting as a client representative in software development contracts and dabbling in writing some utilitarian scripts for in-house use. When I got the opportunity to challenge myself with the opportunity to become a software developer, it seemed like a no-brainer. I love problem solving and helping others. So the way software developers define problems, solve issues and implement technical solutions is very near to my character."
