# Martin Ritsberg Portfolio Site

Welcome. This is my personal portfolio site repo built in Next.js. You can visit the deployed site [here](https://martinritsvoco.github.io/).

## Installation

First this site requires at least Node.js version 20. Node.js v22 was used during development. NPM is required as well.

1. Clone the repository: git clone [repo link]
2. Use NPM to install the requirements: npm install
3. Use npm run dev to start the development version on localhost:3000
4. Push to a GitHub repo and it should automatically run the deployment workflows to deploy it to GitHub Pages, if you have allowed GitHub Pages and Actions in your repo settings, but you'll need to change the code to match the repo URL if you're deploying it to your GitHub user page
